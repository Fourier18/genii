<P>Vision:</P>

<P>Saw Hexagram of Mercury—opened—inside is seal. Drew, intoned name.</P>
<P>Heard Voice: &quot;What do <I>you</I> want?&quot;</P>

<P>Seer mistrusted such a quick response. Drew Banishing Hexagram of Mercury— False! Intoned again, genie name. </P>

<P>Saw Jester, juggling galaxies &amp; (?) Solar systems….he laughed &amp; said: "What can<I> I</I> do for you?"</P>

<P>Tested with Banishing Hexagram of Mercury—melted. Saw black, drew geni seal over it, intoning name (become automatic mantra by now);</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;Show the geni.&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: (Deeply serious) &quot;I am the geni.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer tested with Banishing Hexagram of Mercury, heard:</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;What is your query?&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;What is the Magick?&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Causing Change, Stupid.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;What is the Exorcism?&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Removing Change.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer assumed H[oor]P[aar]K[raat] &amp; wrote this. Will re-invoke now. Did so… Lots of garbage, passed through with lots of testing. After mantra &amp; Seal were objects of sustained dharana, seer asked if symbol on right was yoni and left was lingam.</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Yes—this is apparent from the illustration.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer asked if the symbol in the centre was their product.</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Silence is the reconciler between them.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer tested with Banishing Hexagram of Mercury; crumbled. Saw all as projections of personality. Commanded, drawing Invoking Unicursal Hexagram of the Beast in the name Therion, for the geni to show itself. Saw woman in tattered robe, blue lips—corpse-like. Not mouthing the words, [she] said &quot;here I am.&quot;</P>

<P>Then tested via Banishing Hexagram of Mercury—saw H.Mor.—girl from work—Banished via Hexagram of Mercury—remained! She smiled.  Banished again, via Hexagram of Mercury—remained! She threw her head back in laughter. She said: &quot;I speak through this Other.&quot; Tested,  remained.</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;Very well…illustrate your true form.&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Form is abrogate.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: [Tested, remained.] &quot;How shall the illusion of Form Serve?&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;The slaves shall serve.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;I command thee by Therion, be clear in your response.&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Exactly.&quot;</P>

<P>Tested—saw mud with rotten flesh mixed in. It formed into a face—</P>
<P>Banished via Hexagram of Mercury. </P>

<P>Eyes opened in face, it said: &quot;No. It will not absolve thee.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer told it to be quiet—drew seal/sigil, intoning name. Briefly saw myself in a long pillar’d hall. Walls became yoni on right, phallus on left— from geni sigil. I was the symbol in the centre:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">{Insert Illus.8}</P>

</B><P>Intoned name.</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;I am that.&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;How shall I juggle the complexities of life?&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Prepare for penetration, then yield—(other voices like a ‘wire-crossing’ effect interrupted. </P>

<P>Seer re-invokes.</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Prepare for penetration then yield to thine apsiration.&quot;</P>

<P>Tested with Invoking Hexagram of Mercury. [Geni] Repeated the same thing, remaining. Wrote this.</P>

<I><P>(Remembered that at some point geni ‘as H.’ told me the Seal was of the Beast and  &quot;your Lady&quot;…I asked &quot;why is it just </I>my<I> lady? Is she not of us all?&quot; Voice said &quot;She &amp; He are NOT of ME…but thou art for me, and I for thee.&quot; then tested &amp; saw mud, as written [above].)</P>
</I>
<P>Assumed H[oor]P[aar]K[raat] &amp; acted thus: held dagger to seal, told geni to indwell, that it may assist me in the accomplishment of the Great Work. Felt a sort of ‘quickening’ of thoughts, like a review of all that just occurred. Quickly sealed the seal with Abramelin oil while intoning the name Be<B>o</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=3>qaoooa</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>bitom—then put r[ight] hand over it &amp; gave license to depart into therein [!], ‘coming to my aid by word and deed of magick art’</P>

<P>Heard Voice from ‘in there’ return: &quot;Love is the law, love under will.&quot;</P>

<P>Assumed form of H[oor]P[aar]K[raat], intoned ABRAHADABRA. Wrote this.</P>
