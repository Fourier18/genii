<P>Banished via Air-Pentagram, [heard] female voice: &quot;Thou, movement-- seek every crevice-- all penetrant,  all powerful.&quot; </P>

<P>Tested--remained. Recorded.</P>

</B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>
<P>Will re-invoke, dagger to seal as before. (Faced Alter, in asana.) Saw seal easily--bright red into blue. Commanded geni (by name) to open to me. </P>

<P>Sealís center dilated open like a camera shutter, I went in...saw sky &amp; clouds. I am flying. Saw naked boy, ten or so years old, flying next to me. I said: &quot;Are you the geni?&quot;</P>
<P>He said ëyesí -- I tested via Invoking Unicursal Hexagram of the Beast--disappeared--saw seal on black background.</P>

<P>Inv[oked] via Air-Pentagram; opened as before &amp; shot throughóflying into it. In sky, no ground below. Inv[oked] via Air-Pentagram; saw castle, floating. Went toward it. Inside, saw manuscripts, books, sculptures, paintings, trinkets. Banished [via Air-Pentagram], Invoked [via <I>Averse</I> Air-Pentagram], said G.N.  Boy appeared. Drew sigil over him, said [G.] name. He laughs &amp; kicks back in chair with feet up on desk.</P>

<P>I say: &quot;What is all this art?&quot;</P>

<P>Boy: &quot;Tis yours, your playthings. Your toys.&quot; He snaps his fingers and all begins to <I>burn</I>.</P>
<P>The castle is in flames. The boy and I are untouched. I banish [via Air-Pentagram], burns brighter. He whispers in my ear: &quot;They are toys. Your illusions. Enjoy them.&quot;  I constrain with dagger:</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;How shall I use this in the great work?&quot;</P>

<P>Boy: &quot;In service. Use every scrap. Forget nothing; burn it all!&quot;</P>

<P>Seer Banishes [via Air-Pentagram], sets seal on boy.</P>

<P>Boy says: &quot;It is--your quest.&quot; tested; he says: &quot;Look.&quot;</P>

<P>I Invoke [via Averse Air-Pentagram]...pentagram opens. I look: I see a river-- in blackness a river floats in space, a river of stars, like milk. The boy and I float. <P>Boy says: &quot;Nuit, indeed!&quot; 
<P>I invoke [via Averse Air-Pentagram] 
<P>Female voice (from boy) says &quot;look well--chart your flow.&quot; Tested with Invoking Unicursal Hexagram of the Beast. Remains.</P>

<P>I am in my temple again. There is a tightness in my chest, a dancing pressure. I intuit it to be the geni. My body is still in the same position as when I ëleftí...in dragon asana, dagger in right hand pointing to center of seal on Alter. </P>

<P>Compelled geni to indwell seal by shear direction of attention, telling it &quot;a place is prepared for thee&quot;...As it moved there was a certain feeling of de-pressurization in the ajna, followed by warm tingles in the arms, neck, spine &amp; cranial fissures. Pressure in chest gone...geni in seal.</P>

<P>I anoint sigil (tracing it on paper over ink) with oil [of Abramelin], intoning its name. Put hand over it for license to depart [therein, to indwell]: </P>

<P>            <I>&quot;When I need thee I will call thee by name and signatureóthou wilt then come swiftly as a wind, to participate with one in the Great Work.&quot;</I>  </P>
