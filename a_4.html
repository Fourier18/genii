<U><P>04-01-98ev [Day of Mercury]</P>
</U>
<P>Found Oil—its absence having been an excuse to delay. At this point (<U>2245hrs</U>) I feel compelled to re-invoke A<B>o</B>u-iao-u<B>o</B>a before moving on to the &quot;Magus&quot; geni.</P>

<P>[Furniture] of H.O.O.R. set up in the East in Cave. Pi…. w/ s.… as well. Will set up <B>671</B> Alter in s.w. (astral West) relative to Boleskine. Already sealed [D.Fortune Formula] about an hour ago.</P>

<li>[checkmark] <U>Banish</U>; <B>XXV</B>, Hexagram of Luna, Pentagram of Air (all physical).</li>
<li>[checkmark] <U>Inkvoke</U>; <B>V</B>, Averse Pentagram of Air</li>
<li>[checkmark] [Nuit] Adoration &amp; verse 0 of <B>231</B>. done @ <U>2335hrs.</li>
</U><li>[checkmark] settle into asana—astrally Invoke A<B>o</B>u-iao-u<B>o</B>a with seal.</li>
<li>[checkmark] Vision follows. Robed 0=0, armed with dagger. Began <U>2335hrs</U>.</li>

<P>In astral temple, facing West (<B>671</B> Alter) saw seal. Intoned geni name—saw young boy.</P>

<P>He said: &quot;You called? Yes?&quot;</P>

<P>I said: &quot;Yes.&quot; &amp; tested with Banishing Pentagram of Air. He turned into a silver dragon that bit his own tail &amp; spun as a vertical disc, plane towards me, rotating clockwise.</P>
<P>Banished via Pentagram of Air, remained—spun faster. Told geni to put on human form. Saw boy, had sigil of geni on ajna—tested; Banishing Pentagram of Air, he laughed.</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;Impart to me the knowledge of the Art of change in the mind.&quot;</P>

<P>Boy, voice: &quot;All dies&quot; [garbled]</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;Speak clearly!&quot;</P>

<P>Boy: &quot;Sorrow is not change.&quot;</P>

<P>Tested with Invoking Pentagram of Air, remained.</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;Sorrows are as shadows—&quot; </P>

<P>Voice interrupts: &quot;Sorrow, All is Sorrow—&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;B…….!O……!&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: [in meek voice] &quot;sorry&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;In the art of Therion how may I partake of change in mastering the astral?&quot;</P>
<P>Drew Invoking Unicursal Hexagram of the Beast.</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Do what you are doing now—hell, whatya want from me?&quot;</P>

<P>Seer tested—same sentence echoed but in seer’s own vocal tone. Rejected as false projection.</P>

<P>             <I>[<B>Note on opposite page:</P>
<P>             </B>&quot;Well, in a way the Geni was telling you that you are asking him</P>
<P>              the wrong class of questions.</P>
<P>              Be more direct &amp; flexible with what you ask. If you don’t ask the</P>
<P>              right questions you won’t get useful data. It’s a kind of catch-22.</P>
<P>                                                                   939.’. &quot; <B>]</B></I> </P>

<P>(Physicaly put dagger to seal:)</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;In the name of Therion I instruct A<B>o</B>u-iao-u<B>o</B>a to Obey my Dagger.&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Draw my seal.&quot;</P>


<P>Seer did so—intoned geni name like mantra for three cycles—then seal flashed in mind—dilated like camera shutter, Seer projected thereinto.</P>


<UL>
<LI>On a giant disc, I am in the center. At each quarter a line extends away from me.</LI></UL>

<P>I stand in the Mark of the beast; The Circle is about 11’ in diameter. The lines start at my feet then go out to edge of circle &amp; beyond it.</P>


<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">{Insert Illus.6}</P>
</B>

<P>I realize I am standing on the Seal of A<B>o</B>u-iao-u<B>o</B>a—the four dots are my guardians of</P>
<B><P>XXV</B>, as I sense them more intensely now.</P>

<P>             <B><I>[Notes on opposite page:</P>
</B><P>             &quot;Here you get more with this flash than in the rest of the work combined.</P>
<P>                                                                                939.’.</P>
<P>              One way to work with the genii is to discover what &amp; who they are.</P>
<P>                                                                                939.’. &quot; <B>]</P>
</B></I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I test all with Banishing Pentagram of Air—remained &amp; saw the lines extend out, then bend to make flyfot cross—tested via Invoking Pentagram of Air.</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Every crevice is filled. This is form.&quot; tested via Banishing Pentagram of Air, same voice: &quot;Invoke us.&quot; tested via Banishing Pentagram of Air, remained.</P>
<P>Sigil flashed, Intoned name:</P>

<P>Seer: &quot;Tell me how to enter the realm of the Magus.&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Invoke the Image as you have done with me. We crave thy congress.&quot;</P>

<P>Tested via Banishing Pentagram of Air, felt surge—Invoked via Pentagram of Air, said &quot;Nuit&quot;—felt accumulation behind body of Seer—felt &quot;otherly&quot;, seen as a threat at first. Realized it was geni—tested with Unicursal Hexagram Hexagram of the Beast, Invoking—physically took up dagger as I felt urged, pointed to seal &amp; said: </P>
<P>        </P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;Return now to thine abode to return by call of magick art.&quot;</P>

</I><P>Felt depressurization, &amp; flow into seal. Geni asked to be anointed; took up oil &amp; drew sigil while intoning A<B>o</B>u-iao-u<B>o</B>a. Placed hand on seal &amp; said:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;Love is the law, love under will.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</I><P>Arose &amp; Banished with physical <B>XXV</B>.</P>
