</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=3><P>* Not a good start...from a traditionalist point of view...to mar the Name of the spirit with whom one is attempting to converse. The correct ‘spelling’ of this geni is </I>A<B>o</B>u-iao-<U>u<B>o</B>a</U>, not A<B>o</B>u-iao-<U>a<B>o</B>u.</U> Getting<I> someone’s name wrong may be counted as one cause for failure in the art of conversation...of course, how this effects the relationship greatly depends on how the dialogue develops after the initial slip. In fact, several lasting  friendships have begun with such comedies.------12-26-98ev-</P>
<P>However, note that in the scan of the geni seal used by F.F.F. for these visions the name's spelling is correct - apparently the mistake was in either pronunciation or documentation or both... yet we see that the mistake is later noted. -999- 05-09-03ev

<P>then Curses [in ch.III of <B>Liber Legis]</B>, </P>
<P>then Hexagram of Sol,</P>
<P>then read verse 0 of <B>231.</P>
</B><P>Then Pentagram of Air, Invoke.</P>
<P>Then, vision.</P>

<P>(Done...except Sol, don’t need.)</P>
<P>(Am trying to get Elemental Genii--even though Sol is the heart of Yetzirah/Ruach, it is Planetary, nonetheless.)</P>

<P>Knelt in Dragon, facing Boleskine @ edge of Circle. Seal put between myself &amp; candle:</P>

</B><P>One [cloud of Arabia]. Said Oath. Invoked Air-Pentagram toward Boleskine, armed with Lance. Done four times, once for each letter of RUCh’s [Air’s] divine name, IHVH. Then, closed eyes, held lance, pointed up, @ right side. Left hand on thigh-(attitude of the Dragon-Soldier.) Saw Astral Temple---upright and averse activated. In Astral now---</P>

<P>Stood, drew Air-Pentagram, intoning &quot;A<B>o</B>u-iao-a<B>o</B>u&quot;. Nothing. </P>
<P>Drew again, brighter, intoning geni’s name. Felt a ‘splash’ of sorts…tested with Air-Pentagram, banishing. </P>

<P>Heard chuckling. I asked: &quot;What is the nature of the Geni of the Dome?&quot; </P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Translucent tapestries&quot;</P>

<P>Tested, broke up easily...confirming my intuition that this was false. All became black---drew flaming Pentagram of Air, Invoke. Intoned Name, A<B>o</B>u-iao-a<B>o</B>u. Heard male chuckling---tested with Inv. Pentagram of Air, got louder! </P>


<P>I asked: &quot;What is the word of this geni?&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Translucent.&quot;</P>

<P>Tested--became cacophony. </P>

<P>Saw Seal of A<B>o</B>u-iao-a<B>o</B>u---but had to redraw it several times, as a song by <U>Blues Traveler </U> kept distracting me, playing in my head. Saw seal Clearly. </P>

<P>[I] asked: &quot;Part of the Seal is a sword, is it not?&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;[Got something--too garbled to hear.]</P>

<P>Redrew seal, intoning name of geni.</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;Yesss?&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: (Tested with Seal &amp; imposed Elemental Air-Sigil, remained.) &quot;Is it the sword of the Kerubim?&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: &quot;No!&quot;</P>

<P>Seer: (Tested with Seal, drew Inv. Air-Pentagram.)</P>

<P>Voice: (gruff male laughter)</P>

<P>Seer: (Tested with Seal, hazy. Intoned Geni’s name.) &quot;Show yourself!&quot;</P>

<P>Voice: (Garbled  cacophony)</P>

<P>Seer concluded that the circle was imperfect, as that damn song kept interrupting and the geni’s voice was inconsistent. Judged the vision a failure.</P>

<P>Seer gave license to depart, astrally:</P>

<P>            <I>&quot;Return ye, unto your abodes. Thy voice is unclear, thy visage is hazy. Go!</P>
<P>             Go now unto thine native place, til the Seer again contacts thee with a clear</P>
<P>             signal. Go in Perfect Peace. Love is the law, love under will.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>Assumed H[oor]P[aar]K[raat], in the Temple. Then returned to body, giving sign of Silence. Arose &amp; gave License to depart, as Greek Exorcism. Ended <U>2109hrs.</U>..Put seal back in book [of sigils].</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Note the following; in relation to above:</P>



<P>


<LI>forgot (what is to me) a very important invocation---verse 0 of <B>231</B>
     ...deviation!</LI>
<LI>concentration weak...fatigue, ill circle, etc.</LI>
<LI>did not use Seal soon enough...in fact, should have used it immediately as a portal. Instead, stirrings and splashing in the Lower Astral were taken for the presence of the geni.</P>

With these points in mind I will re-invoke A<B>o</B>u-iao-a<B>o</B>u again.</UL>
